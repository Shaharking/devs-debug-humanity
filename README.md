# devs-debug-humanity
We love silly games, so we've an expansion to Cards Against Humanity focusing the developer way of life. we call it - **devs.Debug(humanity);**.

And the cool thing is - dev against humanity is **devs.Debug(humanity);**. so you may download, print, fork, and contribute your own cards.

## How to print at home?
TBD

## Printed Version
we might still have some printed versions laying, contact us and we'll see what we can arrange.

## Basic rules 
To start the game, each player draws five White Cards. The person with the most commits in the last week begins as the Senior Developer and plays a Black Card. The Senior Developer reads the question or fill-in-the-blank phrase on the Black Card aloud.
Everyone else answers the question or fills in the blank by passing one White Card, face down, to the Senior Developer.
The Senior Developer shuffles all of the answers and shares each card combination with the group. The Senior Developer then picks the funniest play, and whoever submitted it gets one Story Point.
After the round, a new player becomes the Senior Developer, and everyone draws back up to five White Cards. 

## House Rules
Just like Cards Against Humanity we like to sometime remix the rules to make things more interesting. 

+**Race Condition**: A Black Card is drawn only after everyone passed their White Cards. 
+**Sudo**: everyone must say “sudo” before passing their cards. 
+**Artificial Intelligence**: Every round, pick one random White Card from the pile and place it into play. This card belongs to a Deep Neural Network called HAL, and if HAL wins the game, all players go home knowing the AI will soon rule us all.
